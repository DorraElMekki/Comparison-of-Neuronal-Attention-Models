Comparison of Neuronal Attention Models

This repo regroup the results of this research paper: (todo put a link)
To summarize multiple training configuration were tested to understand the impact of each parameter on the Attention model.

## visulization
To visulize the results of each training using Tensorboard :
1. open the Anaconda Prompt
2. change dir to the root of the project
3. tensorboard --logdir logs/
4. open this link http://localhost:6006/

## Dependencies
